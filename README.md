# Scam
SCP:SL Plugin designed to add the most annoying mechanics ever. Only use this plugin if you intend to piss people off, or want the nostalgia of playing SCP:SL before megapatch I again.

## Mechanics
* Scam Keycards - Whenever a player dies, there's a 50% chance they will drop a scam keycard alongside their regular keycard. The scam card will not open any doors, and there's no indicator that it won't until you try to use it. Who scratched off the barcode
* If you try to open a door that requires a keycard without holding a keycard, you will die. Pay attention next time, dummy.
* Doors that require a keycard will just refuse to open/close 50% of the time.
* SCP-914 will not upgrade items 25% of the time.
* Every spawn, you will be exhausted and concussed for 10 seconds. You weren't prepared for the day.
* If you fail to escape the pocket dimension, you will be teleported out (it will appear as though you've escaped) for 5 seconds. And *then* you will die.
* Grenades have a 5% chance to blow up in your hand. Defeats the whole point doesn't it.
* Scp2176's that are thrown softly have a 5% chance to not break for 50 seconds (no, you can't pick them back up).
